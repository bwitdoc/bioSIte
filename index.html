	<h2> California Girl </h2>
	<p class="a">
		Living on the coast of California, Jessica is a 23-year-old singer/songwriter who loves sushi, dogs, and music. 
	Her love for the beach brought her to the Pacific Beach neighborhood of San Diego, California.
	Living about a 5 minute bike ride from the ocean has allowed Jessica many opportunities for beach fun and nightlife.
	With all the fun of beach living, Jessica doesn't forget her roots in East County California.
	Growing up in the East County suburb of San Diego really gave Jessica the love for music that she embodies today.
	She attended Lakeside Middle School, a performing arts school, that encouraged her to pursue band classes and show choir.
	It was in these classes that music became a part of her. She learned the violin in band and also learned how to sing through show choir.
	In doing these things, Jessica began performing in other plays throughout the community into her late teenage years.
	Because of these strong events, Jessica found a deep love and passion for creating music and used her experiences to write her own lyrics.

		Living in San Diego has influenced Jessica's favorite foods because of the extensive diverse culture. Her favorite foods include sushi, mexican food, and macaroni
		and cheese. Even with all the taco shops around, her favorite go-to spot is Taco Bell for their delicious meximelts (recently discontinued). One of her favorite bars
		is 7 Grand in the North Park neighborhood of San Diego. It's a dedicated whiskey bar, which this Irish girl loves. </p>

<!-- Music -->
<h6> Music </h6>
<div class="f">
	<div class="column">
	<p class="f">
		Since music has been a long time passion of hers, it only makes sense that she has musical influences in her writing and style. Some of the artists she accredits
		for influencing her sound is Muse, Halsey, Evanscence, Billie Eilish, Paramore, Taylor Swift, Lorder and David Bowie. In fact, it was at a Kelly Clarkson event that
		Jessica first felt the spark of passion for music. Now she spends most of her time writing and creating songs through her experiences with bits of these artists
		influencing her. </p>
